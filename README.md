#Dungeons and Dragon
This project builds a game in which the warrier is trapped in the dungeons of the evil Black Queen. The user's task is to assist the warrior in finding a way to escape the dungeons. The warrier is placed at the initial chamber and the dungeons are located in the exiting chamber. The warrior can move to chambers that are adjacent (connected), and the objective of the program is to determine the shortest path from the initial chamber to the exit, if such a path exists. The program will show the path and movement of the warrior starting at the initial chamber travelling to the exiting chamber if it is possible along with the shortest path length. 

The following output is runnign from dungeon3 text file and should return to the screen that it's shortest path is 10.
